/// Establishes the authentication boundary in the widget tree.
///
/// Listens to [ProfileCubit] and derives a stable *session key* from the
/// current user id (`'guest'` when unauthenticated). A [KeyedSubtree] keyed
/// on that value wraps the entire user-scoped sub-tree, including [child].
///
/// **Why this matters:** when the session key changes (sign-out → `'guest'`,
/// or `'guest'` → a new authenticated user id), Flutter disposes the entire
/// old sub-tree in full before building the new one. Every user-data BLoC
/// underneath is closed and recreated, so no stale state from a previous
/// session can ever leak into the next.
///
/// **Important – navigator scope:** [child] should contain the [MaterialApp]
/// (or equivalent navigator host). Placing [MaterialApp] *inside* the keyed
/// [MultiBlocProvider] means every route pushed onto the navigator, and every
/// modal bottom sheet, is a descendant of this provider. `context.read<T>()`
/// therefore resolves user-scoped blocs correctly from any route or overlay
/// entry — something that would silently fail if [MaterialApp] were an
/// *ancestor* of this widget.
///
/// Blocs that are *not* user-scoped ([AppSettingsCubit], [ProfileCubit]) live
/// above this widget and are unaffected by the key change.
