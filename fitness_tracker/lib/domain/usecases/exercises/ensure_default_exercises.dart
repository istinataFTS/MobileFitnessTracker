/// Ensures the current user always has a set of default exercises available.

/// This is the per-user counterpart to the global [AppDataSeeder] that runs
/// at bootstrap. It is designed to be called whenever the [ExerciseBloc]
/// finds an empty exercise list after a successful load, acting as a
/// safety-net for these scenarios:
///
/// - A new device/fresh install where the initial cloud sync fetched a user
///   account that has no exercises in the cloud.
/// - A second user logging in on a shared device after the first user's
///   cloud migration claimed the system (null-owner) exercises.
///
/// **Idempotent**: if the user already has at least one visible exercise
/// (system-owned or user-owned), the method returns immediately without
/// touching the database.
///
/// **Factor seeding**: when exercises are freshly inserted the muscle-factor
/// seeding is also triggered, so the fatigue map and stimulus tracking work
/// for the new exercises right away.
