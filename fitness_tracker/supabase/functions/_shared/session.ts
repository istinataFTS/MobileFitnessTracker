/**
 * Appends one turn to a `voice_sessions` row. No-op when `enabled` is false.
 *
 * TODO(C-2): The `enabled` flag currently comes verbatim from the client.
 * Per the C-1 plan §6.8 the server must also validate this against the
 * user's persisted setting (a future `AppSettings.voiceSessionLoggingEnabled`
 * field introduced in C-2) and override the client value if they disagree.
 * Until that AppSettings field exists this defensive lookup cannot be
 * implemented; the lookup + 60 s cache will be added in C-2.
 *
 * Threat model gap until then: a tampered client could opt itself into
 * session logging even if the user toggled it off in Settings. Risk is
 * bounded — a tampered client can already issue any tool call on the
 * user's behalf — but the gap is real and tracked here.
